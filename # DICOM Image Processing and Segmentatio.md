## Introduction

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information. This project focuses on processing and segmenting DICOM images using the YOLOv8 Instance Segmentation model. Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves identifying and delineating individual objects within an image.

The YOLOv8 model is a popular instance segmentation approach that combines object detection and semantic segmentation to accurately locate and classify objects within an image.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.7)
- torchvision (>=0.8)
- OpenCV (>=4.2)
- NumPy
- DICOM Library (e.g., `pydicom`)

You can install these requirements using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dicom-yolov8-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd dicom-yolov8-segmentation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Preprocessing

DICOM images often require preprocessing before they can be used effectively. This may include tasks like normalization, resizing, and data augmentation. The `preprocess.py` script provides functions to preprocess DICOM images.

### Training

To train the YOLOv8 model for instance segmentation, you can use the `train.py` script. You'll need to provide your dataset and set the training configurations such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

```sh
python train.py --data /path/to/dataset.yaml --cfg /path/to/yolov8-config.yaml --weights /path/to/initial/weights.pth
```

### Inference

For performing inference on new DICOM images, you can use the `inference.py` script. This script takes a trained model checkpoint and a DICOM image as input and generates instance segmentation results.

```sh
python inference.py --image /path/to/input.dcm --model /path/to/model.pth --output /path/to/output.png
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation dataset using the `evaluate.py` script.

```sh
python evaluate.py --data /path/to/dataset.yaml --model /path/to/model.pth
```
